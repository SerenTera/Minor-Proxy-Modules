# Abnormality-Tester
Proxy module for abnormality testing purposes. Test any abnormalities by ids, the target and source are both from the playing character, this is just a simple module for me to figure out abnormalties id that can be used.

## Commands
- !abstart (abnormality id)-start an abnormality. eg !abstart 7000001 causes the big head potion to take effect.
- !abend (abnormality id)-end an abnormality.  eg !abend 7000001 causes the big head potion to end its effect.
- !abstack (stack)- change number of stack. eg !abstack 4 changes the stack to 4

By the way, Spot the Big headed elin:
